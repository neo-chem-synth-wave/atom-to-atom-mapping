# Abstract
This work introduces GraphormerMapper, a new algorithm for reaction atom-to-atom mapping (AAM) based on a transformer
neural network adopted for the direct processing of molecular graphs as sets of atoms and bonds, as opposed to
SMILES/SELFIES sequence-based approaches, in combination with the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) network. The graph transformer serves to extract molecular features that are tied to atoms and
bonds. The BERT network is used for chemical transformation learning. In a benchmarking study with IBM RxnMapper, which
is the best AAM algorithm according to our previous study, we demonstrate that our AAM algorithm is superior to it on
our “Golden” benchmarking data set.
