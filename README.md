A **chemical reaction** can be defined as the transformation of a set of chemical compounds into another. Accompanied by
energy change, the atoms of the **reactant chemical compounds** are rearranged to form the **product chemical
compounds**. Therefore, correctly mapping this rearrangement of chemical compound atoms is essential for capturing the
nature of the chemical reaction. This **atom-to-atom mapping** or **atom mapping** task has proven challenging as it is
a generalization of the well-known **subgraph isomorphism problem**. The main objective of the **Atom-to-atom Mapping**
project is to systematically curate and facilitate access to relevant chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping
research resources.


## Installation
A minimal virtual environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands
as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/atom-to-atom-mapping.git

cd atom-to-atom-mapping

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate atom-to-atom-mapping-env
```

The [atom_to_atom_mapping](/atom_to_atom_mapping) package can be locally installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io)
command as follows:

```shell
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```


## Utilization
The purpose of the [scripts](/scripts) directory is primarily to illustrate how to utilize the
[atom_to_atom_mapping](/atom_to_atom_mapping) package. Regardless, the individual scripts can be utilized to run
atom-to-atom mapping on reaction SMILES strings using the following approaches:

1. [Indigo](https://github.com/epam/Indigo) by [EPAM](https://www.epam.com)
2. [RXNMapper](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper) by [IBM RXN for Chemistry](https://rxn.res.ibm.com)
3. [Chytorch RxnMap](https://github.com/chython/chytorch-rxnmap) by [CIMM KFU](https://cimm.kpfu.ru)
4. [LocalMapper](https://github.com/snu-micc/LocalMapper) by [MICC SNU](https://micc.snu.ac.kr)


### Indigo
The **Indigo** <sup>[**[1]**](#references)</sup> chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping approach can be
utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_indigo.py \
  --reaction_smiles "[O-][N+](=O)c1ccc(Br)cn1.CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1>>CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Oc2ccc(nc2)[N+]([O-])=O)cc1"
```

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_indigo.py \
  --input_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "rxn_smiles" \
  --output_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al_indigo.csv"
```


### RXNMapper
The **RXNMapper** <sup>[**[2]**](#references)</sup> chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping approach can be
utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_rxnmapper.py \
  --reaction_smiles "COC(Cl)=O.Fc1cccc(COc2ccc3CCNCCc3c2)c1>>COC(=O)N1CCc2ccc(OCc3cccc(F)c3)cc2CC1"
```

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_rxnmapper.py \
  --input_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "rxn_smiles" \
  --output_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al_rxnmapper.csv"
```

Please keep in mind that the execution device of the model at the center of the **RXNMapper** approach is determined
[automatically](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper/blob/90a7012c9c0127f4a347baf815e270d8807b5a39/rxnmapper/core.py#L73C15-L73C83).
Therefore, the [visibility of the devices](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-control-gpu-visibility-cuda_visible_devices)
and subsequent batch size should be adjusted before executing the scripts.


### Chytorch RxnMap
The **Chytorch RxnMap** <sup>[**[3]**](#references)</sup> chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping approach can
be utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_chytorch_rxnmap.py \
  --reaction_smiles "OCN1C(=O)Cc2ccccc12.c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1>>O=C1Cc2ccccc2N1Cn1cnc2ccccc12"
```

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_chytorch_rxnmap.py \
  --input_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "rxn_smiles" \
  --output_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al_chytorch_rxnmap.csv"
```

Please keep in mind that the execution device of the model at the center of the **Chytorch RxnMap** approach is
[set to the CPU by default](https://github.com/chython/chython/blob/70299a60f1eddb361abb6d89274c21b7cd430f43/chython/__init__.py#L29),
and the number of utilized CPU cores is not easily controllable.


### LocalMapper
The **LocalMapper** <sup>[**[4]**](#references)</sup> chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping approach can be
utilized as follows:

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_local_mapper.py \
  --reaction_smiles "CS(Cl)(=O)=O.OCCN1CCCc2cc(ccc12)C#N>>CS(=O)(=O)OCCN1CCCc2cc(ccc12)C#N"
```

```shell
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_using_local_mapper.py \
  --input_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "rxn_smiles" \
  --output_csv_file_path "data/uspto_50k_by_20171116_coley_c_w_et_al_local_mapper.csv"
```
