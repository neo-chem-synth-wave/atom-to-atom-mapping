Welcome to the chemical reaction compound **Atom-to-atom Mapping** research project !!!

A chemical reaction can be defined as the transformation of a set of chemical compounds into another. Accompanied by
energy change, the atoms of the reactant chemical compounds are rearranged to form the product chemical compounds, with
or without the help of spectator compounds. Therefore, correctly mapping this rearrangement of chemical compound atoms
is paramount for capturing the essence of the chemical reaction. This task, commonly referred to as atom-to-atom mapping
or atom mapping, has proven challenging as it is a generalization of the well-known and NP-complete subgraph isomorphism
problem. Consequently, the main objective of the **Atom-to-atom Mapping** research project is to systematically curate
and facilitate access to relevant chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping resources.


## Installation
A standalone environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands as
follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/atom-to-atom-mapping.git

cd atom-to-atom-mapping

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate atom-to-atom-mapping-env
```

According to the issues [#4](https://github.com/snu-micc/LocalMapper/issues/4) and
[#5](https://github.com/snu-micc/LocalMapper/issues/5) on the official repository, potential conflicts between the
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), and [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai)
libraries may arise during the creation of the standalone environment. The
[appropriate version of the DGL library](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html) can be re-installed using the
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command as follows:

```shell
# Re-install the DGL library for PyTorch and CUDA library versions 2.4 and 12.1, respectively.

pip uninstall dgl

pip install dgl -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.4/cu121/repo.html
```

The [atom_to_atom_mapping](/atom_to_atom_mapping) package can be subsequently installed using the
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command as follows:

```shell
pip install .
```


## Utilization
The purpose of the [scripts](/scripts) directory is to illustrate how to perform chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom
mapping using the following approaches:

1. [Indigo](https://github.com/epam/Indigo) <sup>[[1](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/index.html)]</sup>
2. [RXNMapper](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper) <sup>[[2](/references/2021/20210407_schwaller_p_et_al.md)]</sup>
3. [Chytorch RxnMap](https://github.com/chython/chytorch-rxnmap)
<sup>[[3](/references/2022/20220706_nugmanov_r_et_al.md)]</sup>
4. [LocalMapper](https://github.com/snu-micc/LocalMapper) <sup>[[4](/references/2024/20240313_chen_s_et_al.md)]</sup>

The [map_reactions](/scripts/map_reactions.py) script can be utilized as follows:

```shell
# Map a chemical reaction using the Indigo atom-to-atom mapping approach.

python scripts/map_reactions.py \
  --atom-to-atom-mapping-approach "indigo" \
  --reaction_smiles "OCN1C(=O)Cc2ccccc12.c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1>>O=C1Cc2ccccc2N1Cn1cnc2ccccc12"
```

```shell
# Map the chemical reactions from a .csv file using the RXNMapper atom-to-atom mapping approach.

python scripts/map_reactions.py \
  --atom-to-atom-mapping-approach "rxnmapper" \
  --input_csv_file_path "/path/to/the/input/file.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "name_of_the_reaction_smiles_column" \
  --output_csv_file_path "/path/to/the/output/file.csv"
```
