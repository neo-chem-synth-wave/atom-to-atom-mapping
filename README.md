Welcome to the chemical reaction compound **atom-to-atom mapping** research project !!!

A chemical reaction can be defined as the transformation of a set of chemical compounds into another. Accompanied by
energy change, the atoms of the reactant chemical compounds are rearranged to form the product chemical compounds, with
or without the help of spectator compounds. Therefore, correctly mapping this rearrangement of chemical compound atoms
is paramount for capturing the essence of the chemical reaction. This task, commonly referred to as atom-to-atom mapping
or atom mapping, has proven challenging as it is a generalization of the well-known and NP-complete subgraph isomorphism
problem. Consequently, the primary objective of the **Atom-to-atom Mapping** research project is to systematically
curate and facilitate access to relevant chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping resources.


## Installation
An environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands as follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/atom-to-atom-mapping.git

cd atom-to-atom-mapping

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate atom-to-atom-mapping-env
```

The [atom_to_atom_mapping](/atom_to_atom_mapping) package can be installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command
as follows:

```shell
pip install .
```


## Utilization
The purpose of the [scripts](/scripts) directory is to illustrate how to perform chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom
mapping using the following approaches:

1. Indigo <sup>[[1](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/index.html)]</sup>
2. RXNMapper <sup>[[2](/references/2021/20210407_schwaller_p_et_al.md)]</sup>
3. Chytorch RxnMap <sup>[[3](/references/2022/20220706_nugmanov_r_et_al.md)]</sup>
4. LocalMapper <sup>[[4](/references/2024/20240313_chen_s_et_al.md)]</sup>

The [map_reaction_smiles_strings](/scripts/map_reaction_smiles_strings.py) script can be utilized as follows:

```shell
# Map a chemical reaction SMILES string.
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_strings.py \
  --atom_to_atom_mapping_approach "indigo" \
  --reaction_smiles "OCN1C(=O)Cc2ccccc12.c1nc2ccccc2[nH]1>>O=C1Cc2ccccc2N1Cn1cnc2ccccc12"
```

```shell
# Map the chemical reaction SMILES strings from a .csv file.
python scripts/map_reaction_smiles_strings.py \
  --atom_to_atom_mapping_approach "rxnmapper" \
  --input_csv_file_path "/path/to/the/input/file.csv" \
  --reaction_smiles_column_name "name_of_the_reaction_smiles_column" \
  --output_csv_file_path "/path/to/the/output/file.csv"
```
