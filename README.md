A chemical reaction can be defined as a transformation of one set of chemical compounds to another. The correct mapping of the rearrangement of chemical
compound atoms during the transformation is essential for capturing the essence of a chemical reaction. This task, widely known as atom-to-atom mapping, has
proven quite challenging. Nevertheless, novel approaches are being published frequently. The main goal of this repository is to curate existing open-source
chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping libraries.


## Installation
A minimal virtual environment can be created using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest) as follows:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate atom-to-atom-mapping
```

The package can be locally installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable) as follows:

```shell
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```


## Atom-to-atom Mapping Libraries
The following chemical reaction compound atom-to-atom mapping libraries are currently supported:

1. The **[Chytorch RxnMap](https://github.com/chython/chytorch-rxnmap) <sup>[[1]](#References)</sup>** library
   utilizes a Transformer model for processing chemical compound graphs.
2. The **[EPAM Indigo](https://github.com/epam/Indigo) <sup>[[2]](#References)</sup>** library utilizes a chemical
   compound graph-matching algorithm.
3. The **[LocalMapper](https://github.com/snu-micc/LocalMapper) <sup>[[3]](#References)</sup>** library utilizes a
   human-in-the-loop Message Passing Neural Network model.
4. The **[RXNMapper](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnmapper)  <sup>[[4]](#References)</sup>** library utilizes a
   chemically agnostic attention-guided Transformer model.


## What's Next?
The following updates are currently planned for version **v.2024.07**:

- [ ] Create the _/documentation_ directory.
- [ ] Create the _/notebooks_ directory.
- [ ] Create the _/scripts_ directory.
